        "description": "This research titled 'Unveiling the Influence of Amplifying Language-Specific Neurons' studies the amplification of language-specific neurons in large language models (LLMs). It involves identifying and intervening language-specific neurons in several autoregressive models, with the purpose of model interpretability.",
